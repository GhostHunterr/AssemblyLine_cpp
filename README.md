# Assembly Line Simulation Project Showcase

## Introduction

Welcome to my project showcase! In this section, I'll be presenting my Assembly Line Simulation projectâ€”a C++ object-oriented programming endeavor aimed at simulating an assembly line with multiple stations. This project demonstrates my skills in software development, problem-solving, and project management.

## Project Overview

The Assembly Line Simulation project is a comprehensive application that simulates an assembly line environment where customer orders are processed at various stations. The project involves parsing input files, managing customer orders, and orchestrating the movement of orders along the assembly line. Let's delve into the key components of this project:

## Project Components

### 1. Utilities Module
- **Description:** Responsible for parsing input files and extracting tokens uniformly for all objects within the simulation system.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** File parsing, data extraction, and modular programming.

### 2. Station Module
- **Description:** Manages information about stations on the assembly line, including items handled, serial numbers, and stock quantity.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Object-oriented design, data management, and error handling.

### 3. CustomerOrder Module
- **Description:** Handles individual customer orders, including customer names, products, and items in the order.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data encapsulation, order processing, and status tracking.

### 4. Workstation Module
- **Description:** Represents active stations on the assembly line, fills orders, and moves orders along the line.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Algorithm implementation, order management, and iterative processing.

### 5. LineManager Module
- **Description:** Configures the assembly line, manages order movement, and ensures orders are processed correctly.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** System configuration, order routing, and workflow optimization.
